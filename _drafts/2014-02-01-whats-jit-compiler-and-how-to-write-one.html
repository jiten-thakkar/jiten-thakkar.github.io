<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Compiler is a programme that translates programming code from one form to another. It might be from higher order language or intermediate representation code(known as bytecode) to machine code or it can be from one language to another. Normally we use them to generate executable file that we can run on our computer. The compilers that generate executable files to be run later&nbsp; on are called Ahead-of-Time(AOT) compilers or simply compiler. These are the compilers that we commonly use for languages like C,C++ etc. On the other hand, Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler converts the code in runtime. The feeding code would be a continuous stream of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode" target="_blank">bytecode</a>. The work of converting the language code to bytecode is left to AOT type of compilers. For example, compiler for Java programming language (for example 'javac' from Oracle) generates a .class file (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">Java Class File</a>) which contains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode" target="_blank">Java Bytecode</a>. This .class file is later run in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank">Java Virtual Machine</a>(JVM) which feeds these bytcodes in .class file to a JIT compiler. It generates and executes machine code as it goes on. Here is an image to give you a clear picture.<br />&lt;Image&gt;<br /><br />Why do we need JIT compiler?<br /><br />How to write a simple JIT compiler?<br />Example</div>
