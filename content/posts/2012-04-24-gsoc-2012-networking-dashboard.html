<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">My proposal for 'Networking Dashboard' for 'Mozilla' got selected for GSoC 2012 today :).<br />I have been a contributor to Mozilla for a long time now. Till now mostly it was bug fixes.<br />But now I will be working on something real for Mozilla. My project is to make a tool for developers which allows them to have an insight of Mozilla networking. Google chrome already has something similar - "chrome://net-internals". This tool will be implemented as an add-on. The link to my proposal is <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pehh1qqwadnw455/Gsoc%20Proposal.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>. It has a description about what&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;will be implemented. I wish I have a link to the add-on soon. I might blog about my experience with necko and about my progress in future. Stay tuned.<br /><br /></div>
