<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So far I have finally finished implementing back-end interfaces- nsIHttpConnectionLog.idl, nsiWebSocketConnectionLog.idl, nsISocketLog.idl and nsIDNSEntries.idl. for Networking Dashboard.<br />Now, only thing remains is a UI for the add-on using these interfaces. It's very important part of the project since it will make sense of the json strings returned by these interfaces. Without a UI they are merely strings of data. I will probably be using jquery UI for this. It will be a tabular UI, a tab per interface/feature. Implementation of UI will conclude my GSoC project.</div>
